	  <center><p>This was one of the first projects I made using p5.js. It is an interactive 3D model of a table– users can click and drag to see all the table from all angles.</p></center>
	  <center><p>The hardest part of this project for me was thinking through the z-axis and how it would appear as users scrolled around the table. I navigated this by making one cube that I used as a foundational cube– I thought about all of the other cubes' postions as relative to the main one.</p></center>
	  <center><p>Overall, this project really helped me get a feel for p5.js and a better understanding of how to navigate the z-axis, especially with the x and y axes.</p></center>
