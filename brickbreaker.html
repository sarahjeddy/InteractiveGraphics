	  <center><p>This was one of the larger projects I made using Apple II Basic. It is an interactive brick breaker game. This was one of the tougher projects I've done this year because it involved both creating something that people could interact with and making it function well.</p></center>
	  <center><p>For this project, one of the most useful Apple II BASIC functions I used was "SCRN" which allowed the ball to essentially check what was in front of it. This was helpful because that indicates whether the ball has hit a brick, the paddle, or the boundaries.</p></center>
	  <center><p>I began this project with a bouncing ball. It originally moved faster, but I slowed it down for this project. The bounching ball is shown below.</p></center>
