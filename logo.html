	  <center><p>This project was the first one I made using Apple II BASIC. One of the main goals was to become more comfortable coding with Basic and to gain a better understanding of graphics on older computers and systems.
		  </p></center>
	  <center><p>I began this project by sketching out an idea of what I wanted my logo to look like on the Apple II screen. From there, I used "HLIN" and "VLIN" commands to draw it out.</p></center>
	  <center><p> An issue I ran into translating  my sketch into a coded version is the shape of the letters. This had a large impact on my logo because I designed it with square pixels in mind, but Apple II has more rectangular pixels.</p></center>
	  <center><p>Despite this logo not turning out exactly how I imagined it, it was still a really good way to be introduced to coding with Apple II Basic and I learned a lot.</p></center>
